# GrowthBook Jira App

An Atlassian Forge app for use linking Jira issues to GrowthBook features and experiments.

## Local Development

See [Set up Forge](https://developer.atlassian.com/platform/forge/set-up-forge/) for instructions to get set up.

### Notes

- Use the `forge tunnel` command to enable hot-reloading between your computer and the development environment.
- Use the `forge deploy` command when you want to persist code changes.
- Use the `forge install` command when you want to install the app on a new site.
- Once the app is installed on a site, the site picks up the new app changes you deploy without needing to rerun the install command.

## Connecting to a self-hosted GrowthBook instance

Forge apps must specify what urls they connect to before they're published, so to use this app with a non-cloud
instance of GrowthBook you'll need to make a fork of this repo and apply a few edits

1. Create a new [Atlassian Forge app](https://developer.atlassian.com/platform/forge/build-a-hello-world-app-in-jira/) locally
2. Take the app ID from the generated `manifest.yml` and use it to replace our app ID in your fork's `manifest.yml`.
3. Update the references to `api.growthbook.io` and `app.growthbook.io` to use your corresponding URLs in both `manifest.yml` and `src/utils/consts.ts`.
4. You should end up with the following diff

```diff
